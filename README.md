## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | h | h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 6.1h | 26.6h | 110.6h | 354.6h |
| AI worker hours | 11.7h | 59.8h | 186.7h | 1020.8h |
| AI concurrency hours | 23.9h | 115.3h | 375.2h | 1,761.2h |
| Interactive sessions | 9 | 40 | 93 | 855 |
| Worker sessions | 24 | 69 | 512 | 2,238 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 85 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

| Model | Requests | Input | Output | Cache read | API Cost | Cache savings | Model savings |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| gpt-5.5 | 51,418 | 243.1M | 9.2M | 3,715.8M | $1,723.69 | $10,032.69 | $7,933.63 |
| gpt-5.4-mini | 508 | 2.6M | 44K | 16.9M | $1.34 | $31.81 | $51.22 |
| **Total** | **51,926** | **245.8M** | **9.3M** | **3,732.7M** | **$1,725.03** | **$10,064.50** | **$7,984.85** |

_3,987.9M total tokens processed. 93.6% cache hit rate._

_$18,049.35 total saved ($10,064.50 caching + $7,984.85 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~93.6% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
