## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | h | h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 4.4h | 26.4h | 110.1h | 352.9h |
| AI worker hours | 13.6h | 57.2h | 182.4h | 1015.7h |
| AI concurrency hours | 23.9h | 113.7h | 370.6h | 1,754.1h |
| Interactive sessions | 8 | 39 | 93 | 854 |
| Worker sessions | 17 | 59 | 507 | 2,225 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 85 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

| Model | Requests | Input | Output | Cache read | API Cost | Cache savings | Model savings |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| gpt-5.5 | 50,708 | 240.1M | 9.1M | 3,679.0M | $1,704.15 | $9,933.37 | $7,845.13 |
| gpt-5.4-mini | 508 | 2.6M | 44K | 16.9M | $1.34 | $31.81 | $51.22 |
| **Total** | **51,216** | **242.8M** | **9.1M** | **3,695.9M** | **$1,705.49** | **$9,965.18** | **$7,896.35** |

_3,948.0M total tokens processed. 93.6% cache hit rate._

_$17,861.53 total saved ($9,965.18 caching + $7,896.35 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~93.6% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
