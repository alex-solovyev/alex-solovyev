## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | h | h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 7.0h | 25.8h | 111.2h | 356.8h |
| AI worker hours | 16.2h | 60.7h | 193.1h | 1029.4h |
| AI concurrency hours | 28.3h | 113.6h | 382.8h | 1,773.6h |
| Interactive sessions | 7 | 42 | 91 | 857 |
| Worker sessions | 42 | 82 | 518 | 2,260 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 86 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

| Model | Requests | Input | Output | Cache read | API Cost | Cache savings | Model savings |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| gpt-5.5 | 52,695 | 249.3M | 9.4M | 3,786.5M | $1,761.14 | $10,223.68 | $8,105.71 |
| gpt-5.4-mini | 508 | 2.6M | 44K | 16.9M | $1.34 | $31.81 | $51.22 |
| **Total** | **53,203** | **252.0M** | **9.5M** | **3,803.5M** | **$1,762.48** | **$10,255.49** | **$8,156.93** |

_4,065.0M total tokens processed. 93.6% cache hit rate._

_$18,412.41 total saved ($10,255.49 caching + $8,156.93 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~93.6% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
