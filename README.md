## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | h | h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 6.1h | 26.6h | 110.6h | 354.6h |
| AI worker hours | 11.9h | 60.5h | 187.6h | 1021.6h |
| AI concurrency hours | 24.0h | 116.0h | 376.0h | 1,762.0h |
| Interactive sessions | 9 | 40 | 93 | 855 |
| Worker sessions | 25 | 70 | 513 | 2,239 |

_Screen time from systemd-logind session events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 85 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

| Model | Requests | Input | Output | Cache read | API Cost | Cache savings | Model savings |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| gpt-5.5 | 51,555 | 243.5M | 9.3M | 3,723.9M | $1,727.29 | $10,054.54 | $7,950.04 |
| gpt-5.4-mini | 508 | 2.6M | 44K | 16.9M | $1.34 | $31.81 | $51.22 |
| **Total** | **52,063** | **246.2M** | **9.3M** | **3,740.8M** | **$1,728.63** | **$10,086.34** | **$8,001.26** |

_3,996.4M total tokens processed. 93.6% cache hit rate._

_$18,087.60 total saved ($10,086.34 caching + $8,001.26 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~93.6% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
