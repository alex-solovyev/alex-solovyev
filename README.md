## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Linux) | 24h | 168h | 670.9h | ~8703h* |
| Interactive human attention | 5.4h | 35.9h | 107.6h | 352.7h |
| Interactive AI generation | 2.8h | 19.6h | 96.0h | 428.1h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 0.3h | 6.7h | 17.6h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 11.1h | 43.4h | 246.6h | 1168.2h |
| Additive observed work | 19.3h | 99.3h | 454.9h | 1,959.0h |
| Interactive sessions | 8 | 11 | 105 | 1,243 |
| Worker sessions | 122 | 481 | 2,516 | 8,906 |

_Screen time from linux-wtmp:login-session-proxy; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 110 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

| Model | Requests | Input | Output | Cache read | API Cost | Cache savings | Model savings |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| gpt-5.5 | 56,461 | 246.9M | 10.5M | 4,108.6M | $1,853.03 | $11,093.28 | $8,525.18 |
| gpt-5.6-sol | 3,842 | 17.4M | 977K | 267.8M | $268.75 | $723.24 | $589.44 |
| gpt-5.4-mini | 306 | 1.3M | 20K | 7.9M | $0.65 | $14.87 | $25.14 |
| **Total** | **60,609** | **265.6M** | **11.5M** | **4,384.4M** | **$2,122.43** | **$11,831.39** | **$9,139.75** |

_4,661.6M total tokens processed. 94.1% cache hit rate._

_$20,971.14 total saved ($11,831.39 caching + $9,139.75 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~94.1% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
